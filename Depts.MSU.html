                As students of history, we pursue inquiry for the sake of inquiry. At Montclair State University, you will learn to question the world around you. You will gain knowledge of history, analyze and interpret original sources, and contextualize them in papers, digital media, podcasts, online discussion posts, and internships at leading institutions. The knowledge and skills you learn translate into fulfilling careers.
